"# Image-Captioning" 

This project demonstrates an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for images. The model utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequence generation to predict captions for a given image.

Overview
The goal of this project is to create a system capable of analyzing an image and generating a human-readable description based on its content. The model employs the following architecture:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):
Extracts high-level features from the image. A pre-trained CNN model such as InceptionV3 or ResNet is used as a feature extractor.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
Once the CNN extracts features from the image, these features are passed to an LSTM network, which generates a sequence of words to form a caption.
The LSTM is trained on sequences of words to model the temporal dependencies between them, allowing the generation of grammatically correct captions.
Features
Image Upload: Upload an image via the web interface and generate a caption for the uploaded image.
Model Architecture: A hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture that combines image processing and language modeling for caption generation.
Pre-trained Models: Pre-trained models like InceptionV3 for feature extraction are fine-tuned to work with your image data.
Real-time Caption Generation: The application provides real-time captions for uploaded images using the trained model.
